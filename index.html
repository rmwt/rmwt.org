         <p><strong>Beads of Courage Bowls Workshop</strong></p>
         <p>August 6, 2016, 9am - 4:30pm

Dale Bonertz and Allen Jensen - From log to rough turned bowl blank

This club event will cover chain sawing a log, band sawing the block of wood, sharpening/reshaping tools, roughing bowl blanks and discussing drying blanks.

All blanks will be used for Beads of Courage.

We ask folks to bring eye protection at minimum. Face shield is better and hearing protection for the chain saw area is highly recommended. It is also encouraged to bring a gouge or two that folks are trying to get a certain grind. They can also practice sharpening even if they have a favorite grind on their tool but want to learn how to get them sharper.

Lunch will be provided for those who register.

This event will be held at Allen Jensen's shop located at 6235 N. County Rd 13 Loveland, CO 80538.

Please contact Allen, rajconst@aol.com or Dale, dbonertz@comcast.net for more information.

        <p><strong>RMWT Beyond the Bark, November 2nd to 12th</strong></p>
          <p>Breaking news!  The Rocky Mountain Woodturners will have a group show, Beyond the Bark, at the Community Creative Center (formerly the Carnegie Building, around the corner from the library) at 200 Mathews Street in Fort Collins from November 2nd to 5th and 9th through 12th.  The show will not be juried, so everyone will have equal opportunity to enter and exhibit, and we hope that all members will display at least one piece.  There will be an area for pens and other small items.  These dates include the First Friday Art Walk, which always brings a large audience to an exhibit.  The gallery will be open Wednesday through Saturday from noon to 6 PM each of these two weeks, with the First Friday Art Walk reception from 6 PM until 9 PM on Friday, November 4th.  Members may exhibit up to five pieces of their best work. We will have the gallery space we've had in the previous exhibits and Larry Tucci, painter, will have the entire rest of the gallery.</p>

<p>Please bring your turned pieces to either Woodcraft, site of our meetings, or Lloyd Jenkins' house, 1166 Cobblestone Court, in Fort Collins, 970-226-1166 (call first)
between now and Saturday, October 29th.  Lloyd has not been able to attend our meetings in over a year, so he would be glad to have participating woodturners come by.</p>

<p>Each piece, except for small items such as pens, must be in an individual box and the box must be marked with artist's name and the name of the piece.   Each artist must fill out one of the Lincoln Center Exhibit Participant forms at the drop-off site, one form for all of your pieces, and include the sale price for each piece, if it is for sale. <a href="images/community-creative-center-form.pdf" target="_blank"> Community Creative Center Form (click on this for a printable pdf file).</a></p>   

<p>Each turner is encouraged to select a two-hour time slot when you will be available in the gallery to meet and greet visitors and tell them about woodturning.  This is not a scary thing to do--most turners have found that gallery visitors are eager to know what woodturning is and a little about how we do it, and it is fun.  The sign-up grid will be sent in a separate message.</p>
 
 <p>Let's continue to show Northern Colorado what woodturning is   </p>

<p>I was born and raised in Lima, Peru.  A country that is diverse and rich of wood and natural landscapes. My father has been a craftsman since I remember, everywhere we lived he always had his shop on the rooftop of the house we lived, it was always fun coming to play in his shop, feel the wood texture and smell. All he would let me do was sweep and plane by hand.  That is how my love and interest for wood started. My dad has been a great influence in the craft, his love and passion for it has grow on me. I remember every time we go to buy wood he will smell it and sometimes taste it (in Peru they could sell you something that would say is mahogany and was not, and by tasting it will be his way of determining, I know... weird). Now every time I go look for wood, smells and textures get my attention. For the last 5 years I've been mainly focused on woodturning, it is my favorite past time or hobby. I have met some amazing people in the craft and have had the honor of having a mentor (Mauricio Kolenc) from Uruguay; his passion and love for the traditional craft has caught my attention, and sparked my interest. Hand thread chasing is what I have been trying to perfect lately.   Just like the good Ol' Bill Jones would say repetitive work is the key, and he compared turning like singing "If it's easy it's sheer heaven, but if it's forced ugh!"

<p>I began to turn wood in England in 1970 at the age of 26 and after a successful career in the London wine trade.  I was never a hobby turner.  When I decided to turn wood for a living late in 1969 I knew nothing of the craft other than it involved a lathe and tools with long handles. I reckoned that if I enjoyed the craft all I had to do was develop good technical skills and marketing, and I’d earn a decent living selling what I enjoy making. And that that’s what I’ve done since mid-1970, first in England, then, from 1982, Australia. Being the only turner juried into The Craftsman’s Art, a seminal exhibition in London in 1973, was a great boost to my career as that led to my bowls being in a lot of major exhibitions and on the British Crafts Council Slide Index Selection Panel from 1973 to 1980.</p>

<p>In 1970 I had to create a market for the one-off bowls I inevitably produced as a novice, but after two sales trips I got repeat orders. I was turning utilitarian bowls, scoops, and plates that sold to kitchen, gift, and souvenir shops; and I also sold a lot of delicate bowls, scoops, and boxes to gift shops and craft galleries. I never needed to consign work and that’s why I’ve seldom had work in American galleries. Moving to Australia in 1982 was risky business-wise because I had to start over in a new environment, but fortunately that didn’t take too long.</p>

<p>I began teaching formally in 1978 when Highland Craftpoint, in Scotland, asked me to advise embryo craft businesses in the Highlands and Islands. Apart from that I did very little teaching until I became a regular presenter for Dale Nish at the Utah Woodturning Symposiums in the 1980s; then demand took off after my book and video Turning Wood with Richard Raffan were published in 1985. Subsequent books and videos increased requests for me to lead workshops, and, although I enjoy teaching, it’s only ever been ancillary to my woodturning business  and a welcome change from my workshop routine.</p>

<p>I am proud of the fact that, unlike so many in the arts and crafts community, I have always been able to earn a good living by selling what I make (rather than teaching to pay the bills).  However, after forty years of turning wood, and as I drift into my retirement years, I’m moving away from the lathe and making a few little boats and other stuff using wood and found bits and pieces — and having a great time.</p>

      <p>Ashley Harwood currently lives in Charleston, SC, where she creates her work and teaches at her personal studio. She has demonstrated in a number of professional venues throughout the US and abroad, as far away as Australia. Her teaching focuses on fine spindle turning and the Push Cut method of bowl turning along with the 40/40 grind on a bowl gouge. She received a BFA from Carnegie Mellon with a focus in sculpture and installation, and her design aesthetic is heavily influenced by her background in glassblowing. Ashley focuses on works that are completed entirely on the lathe, without carving, texturing, or burning.  She uses simple, classic forms along with distinctive design elements that result in an approachable body of work with a high level of craftsmanship. Primarily, she makes utilitarian bowls, ornaments, and jewelry.  Her teaching has a strong focus on tool control and sharpening.</p> 
<p>Find out more about Ashley by visiting her website: ashleyharwood.net</p>
<p> 

Key points:

For this demonstration, I will show how I turn and assemble a sea urchin ornament with a fine ebony spindle. I begin by demonstrating all of the fundamental cuts of spindle turning on a larger piece of wood. I break down the actions of each hand and the way that my tool cuts in order to achieve a finish ready for 180 grit straight off of the tool. Next, I turn a fine ebony spindle using a half inch bowl gouge, a ¼ inch detail gouge, and a vortex tool. </p>

        <p>Although he is a relatively new wood artist, Rudolph Lopez has always had a love of natural objects and the environment in which they flourish. Growing up on a cattle ranch in Florida with his father and uncles who spent most of their time in the woods, he grew to love the outdoors... trees, water and all things relating to nature. To this day, Rudy’s greatest pleasures come from mountain-biking, canoeing, kayaking, hiking and just being in the woods.</p> 

<p>Rudy began working with his hands at a very young age and began to develop his creative eye through photography—his first artistic pursuit. With an education in drafting and design, he drew inspiration from the surroundings of his youth, Rudy began his relationship with wood as a craftsman of fine furniture and cabinetry. His desire to explore wood-turning began to develop when he received a natural-edge turned bowl as a Christmas gift from his best friend two years ago. Since that time, Rudy’s natural sense of curiosity has led him to explore the techniques necessary to transform wood from a simple rough chunk into an piece of aesthetic beauty. He has the ability to look at an object, understand how it is made, and recreate it with very little effort. It is as if his brain is linked to his hands by some arcane memory.</p>  

<p>When asked what kind of wood he most likes to turn, Rudy’s response was, “imperfect wood, wood with knots, voids, worm holes, decay or any other flaw or defect. To me this is the beauty that God and nature has provided me with as a starting point, and then it becomes a challenge for me to continue this and create something of beauty for others to enjoy”. Rudy’s turned pieces have been featured in the “Rounding The Four Corners” exhibit 2008 and “Restful Places-Cremation Urns and Objects” 2009 at the AAW Gallery of Wood Art in St. Paul, Minnesota. </p>

        <p>Neil Turner now resides on a 10 acre wooded block at Stratham 11 kilometers south of Bunbury. The years spent on his wheat and sheep farm 180 km east of Perth in Western Australia provided the opportunity to use timber normally overlooked and neglected by other woodworkers. His early years were spent juggling work and family with occasional woodturning. He has been turning and sculpting timber for over 34 years, attending workshops whenever possible to improve his technique and sharpen his focus and skills. In 2011 Neil attained a Diploma of Fine Furniture from the Australian School of Wood in Dwellingup. He will incorporate his many skills to make art furniture.</p>

<p><strong>Artist's Statement</strong></p>

<p>My rural environment greatly influenced me, as I was able to observe the wind, fire and water impact the land. My intention is to incorporate these aspects into work that has a free, expressive and organic appearance while using carving and turning techniques to achieve a purity of form.</p>

<p>Timber is a living breathing organism that captures my imagination. The opportunity to express thoughts and ideas in a tangible creation that continues to react within its environment. To design and create in timber presents many challenges both in structure and integrity but the pleasure I derive from my work is simple, a joy and passion to create pieces of work that I like.</p>

        <p>This project demonstration will highlight one   of the methods for incorporporating metal into your work that I will be   covering during my &quot;Metal Accents for Wooden Boxes&quot; symposium   demonstration.</p> 
        <p>Woodworking has been a major interest of mine for many years now. My early training came from college level woodworking and furniture design courses in San Diego, while my later training came from courses taken in the Fine Woodworking Department at Red Rocks Community College (RRCC) where I currently teach.</p>
	
<p>While I enjoy making projects from furniture to small craft items, turning projects are by far my favorites.  I feel nothing highlights and celebrates the beauty of wood quite the same way as turnings.  In addition to turning wood, I also like to incorporate metal into some of my pieces through the use of metal spinning and other techniques.</p>

<p>Currently I run my own small woodworking business and teach courses in, depending on the semester, general woodworking, furniture making, and turning. For more, visit www.facebook.com/glacialstudio</p>

<p>My intent is to just do an overview of the power carving, wood burning and painting techniques Dixie covered in the class. I'll likely be carving a center piece for a box top.</p> 

<p>I  will emphasize power carving techniques, talk about which carving tools and burs she recommends, how to use dry brushing to color pieces and demonstrate several texturing methods including the use of the wood burner.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Tom Wirsing was born in Roanoke, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley, an historic center of American woodturning.</p>

<p>Tom began turning wood as a young boy. After graduating from Roanoke College with a degree in Physics, Tom began traveling extensively. He lived in Europe, Asia, and 9 US States. The lathe in his dad’s workshop became distant memory.</p>

<p>About 20 years ago Tom found himself working for the Hewlett-Packard Company in Chicago, and living in a house with a spacious basement. He bought a lathe, and began turning wood again. At first he made mostly furniture, but almost by chance, he attended a demonstration by Richard Raffan, a very well-known Australian woodturner, who specializes in turning beautiful wooden bowls. Richard took a rough piece of American black cherry timber and turned it into a wonderful bowl. Tom was hooked.</p>

<p>Thus began Tom’s interest in creating art pieces on the lathe. He now turns primarily bowls and platters from a variety of woods. His favorite is figured maple.</p>

<p>Tom is a member of the American Association of Woodturners. Tom has served as two-term president of the Denver chapter of the AAW, and has served two terms as president of the AAW.</p>

<p>Tom resides with his wife Melinda on a small ranch in north Boulder County, Colorado where he grazes Angus cattle and turns wood in his studio overlooking the Colorado Front Range.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone Can Turn a Perfect Bowl</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this demonstration is twofold: <br />
  1.	To demonstrate techniques for turning a “perfect bowl” using a combination of gouges and scrapers. <br />
  2.	To focus especially on easily-mastered techniques for the use of   negative-rake scrapers to fine-tune shapes and curves and eliminating   all irregularities and tear-out, even on difficult, highly-figured   hardwoods.</p>

<p>It is my belief that artists of all kinds express what is meaningful in their lives, and in the world that they live in, through their artwork.
  Our values, emotions, fears, and delights emerge through the work of our hands. Art is, and historically has always been, a vitally important element of every civilized human society.</p>

<p>Beauty is important to me. I surround myself with the beauty of Nature. I love to work with the most beautiful and precious materials.
In my artwork, I express my love of the beauty in our world.</p>

<p>The finely finished interior spaces, and the jewels that I hide inside my pieces, express my feeling that the most precious treasures in life are those that are hidden from view. I like to look on the bright side, seeking out the hidden opportunities that are there for those who make the extra effort to look.
Treasures are found in the love of a life-long friend, in "taming" a feral cat, and in the view from the top of a steep mountain climb.</p>
